Personal CV Webpage using HTML &amp; CSS


I reviewed my existing personal CV webpage created using HTML.

I identified areas where CSS styling could enhance the visual appeal and readability of the content.

I applied CSS to format the text, added colors, chose appropriate fonts, and adjusted spacing to create a visually appealing design.

I utilized CSS to create a consistent layout by defining styles for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements.

I enhanced the existing sections with CSS styling, such as applying different background colors or border styles.

I introduced additional content sections to provide more comprehensive information about myself, including:
a. Skills and Proficiencies: I created a section to list my key skills and proficiencies related to my field of interest.
b. Work Experience: I included a section to outline my previous work experiences, internships, or volunteer activities.
c. Education: I added a section to showcase my educational background, including degrees, certificates, and relevant courses.
d. Projects: I highlighted any notable projects I have worked on and provided brief descriptions and relevant links.
e. Achievements or Awards: I created a section to highlight any significant accomplishments or awards I have received.

I incorporated appropriate CSS styles for these additional sections to maintain visual consistency with the rest of the webpage.

I ensured that my webpage remained responsive by using media queries to adjust the layout and styling for different screen sizes.

I tested my enhanced personal CV webpage across various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and functionality.

I shared my updated webpage with others and gathered feedback for further improvements and refinements.

Creativity was rewarded, and I added elements, sections, and features that I wanted to include.
